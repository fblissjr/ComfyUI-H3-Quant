"""Rebalance q/k channels before INT8 attention on the blocks whose K-norm is lopsided.

## What it fixes, and where

MiniMax H3's last transformer block carries almost all of its K energy in four
channels (82, 34, 67, 19 after RoPE), because `attn.k_norm.weight` peaks there
by an order of magnitude. Both INT8 attention kernels on these graphs -- sage's
and Sol's -- quantize K per block of tokens with ONE scale across all 128
channels, so on that block four channels set the scale and the other 124 keep
about three bits. The block's attention is also the peakiest in the model
(a handful of effective keys per query on its worst heads), so a small
relative error in K becomes a large logit error and the softmax flips.
Measured: sage's INT8 error at block 49 is ~5x block 0's, and K's rounding is
almost all of it. the h3-explorations repo's `docs/h3_block49_quant_error.md` has the
anatomy; the sage fork's `CHANGELOG.md` (workload intel, "MiniMax H3, block
49") has the tables.

## What it does

For any per-channel factor s, `q . k == (q * s) . (k / s)`, so the channels
can be rebalanced before quantization at no cost to the attention math, and
Sol's routing threshold is invariant under the same rescale. H3 applies its
q/k RMSNorm weights right before RoPE, and its RoPE is split-half over
channels 0..95, rotating (i, i+48) together. A factor that is EQUAL within
each such pair commutes with the rotation, so it folds into the two norm
weights themselves: `k_norm.weight / s` and `q_norm.weight * s`. This node
adds exactly those two weight patches, per named block, through
`ModelPatcher.add_patches` -- applied when the model loads, undone when it
unloads, nothing patched in ComfyUI core, no cost at render time.

The factor comes from the checkpoint's own norm weights,
`s = |kw|^alpha / |qw|^(1-alpha)`, pair-averaged, normalized to a geometric
mean of one. That needs no capture, so it covers blocks that were never
captured, and it is neutral where the weights are flat: measured on block 0
the patched call reproduces the unpatched error to four decimals. A factor
calibrated per head removes about twice as much error at block 49 but
cannot fold into a per-channel weight; that form lives inside the sage
fork's per-thread quantizer as `qk_balance` (its v0.7.19), computed per
call, and reaches only the sage steps until Sol's quantizer gets the same.

## Off by default, and an experiment

`balance="off"` adds no patch. The other two modes are an EXPERIMENT under
`docs/SOLATTN.md`'s decision standard, not a shipped default: the sage-side
gain is measured on captures, the Sol-side gain is
`bench/grade_channel_balance.py`'s to establish, and nothing here is
perceptual. Which blocks are lopsided is a property of the released weights:
`bench/check_channel_balance.py` ranks all 50 from the shipped checkpoint
(measured 2026-09-14: top-4 K-norm energy share 70% at block 49, 31% at 45,
25% at 48, and 4-6% everywhere else).
